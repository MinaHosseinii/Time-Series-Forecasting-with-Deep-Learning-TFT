# Time-Series-Forecasting-with-Deep-Learning-TFT
Solar Energy Generation Forecasting for Germany

For the modern deep learning Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), the performance of the evaluated forecasting for day-ahead solar power pre-
diction on 30 November 2022 is evaluated using standard metrics including RMSE, MAE, MSE, and R2. 

These visualizations highlight the ability of the TFT model to closely follow the
true generation profiles. 

The Weighted Multi-Quantile Loss (WMQLoss) was used to reduce the impact of extended nighttime zero-production periods, TFT produced an RMSE of 692.08 MW
and R2 = 0.684. The forecast curve shown in Figure 10a further illustrates these discrepancies.
